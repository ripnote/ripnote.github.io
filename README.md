# DRAFT NOTES

This is where I'll push the raw versions of my notes... people are welcome to browse if they want, but these are not reliable source of information/knowledge. **I've been known to f*ckup the first notes I take on any subject.**

Built on [NoteTheme](https://dinhanhthi.github.io/notetheme/) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
